</h2>

					<h5><strong>1.	7 - 12 years</strong></h5>
					<p>Are you waiting to see your child "old enough" for braces, before you start visiting your orthodontists? Dr. Karan Tangri, an expert in <b> braces treatment in Delhi</b>, recommends that your child's first visit to an orthodontist should be at 7 years of age, to see how the teeth are erupting. At this age, problems like uneven bite and tooth overlapping will become common. But, starting the early stage procedure doesn't mean that a child will get braced right away. Early stage processing will allow orthodontist to find problems and decide the best time to start treatment. There are times when your children might lose their milk teeth early (due to cavities), leading to premature eruption of permanent teeth in an abnormal position. In these circumstances an early intervention of an orthodontist will be required.</p>
					
					<p>According to the experts of braces treatment in Delhi, there are certain orthodontic appliances that can correct and modulate the jaw growth in the correct manner, only if the child visits the orthodontist in the growing stage.</p>
					<h5><strong>2.	12- 18 years</strong></h5>
					<p>The teenage years (between the ages of 12 and 18) are the most common time for orthodontic treatment. That's because by age of 12 years, most, if not all, of your permanent teeth have erupted and are in place so cracked tooth, bad bites and gaping between teeth can be easily observed. These dental difficulties are rarely correct themselves, so this is time when the majority of people seek braces treatment in Delhi. </p>
					<h5><strong>3.	Adult orthodontics </strong></h5>
					<p>Thinking about getting braces? There is no age limit. Now days, there are nearly half of adult patients hoping to finally get the perfect smile they've always dreamt about. There is no set age after which orthodontic treatment is not possible. According to the experts of braces treatment in Delhi, it is not the age but the health of alveolar bone that determines whether treatment by braces will be possible or not. 
Tongue thrust is a condition in which teeth in adults can shift according to the age, because of injury or tooth damage and natural growth. Some adults find that their previously straight teeth have become crooked and overcrowded or there is spacing between their teeth. They may start experiencing jaw pain, have difficulty in properly cleaning their teeth, or simply find their smile unattractive. Other adults get braces because they've always had crooked teeth, but for some reason they did not get braces when they were growing up.

                        <p>Traditional braces are the composition of metal brackets and wires, however, modern braces are small in size and less noticeable. New technology based heat-activated arch wires helps teeth to move more quickly and less painfully than in the past. These are the least expensive braces but disadvantage is that they are more noticeable.</p>

                        <p>Ceramic braces are similar in shape and size as metal. According to the specialists of Braces treatment in Delhi, the only difference is that, Ceramic Braces have tooth-colored or clear brackets that blend in to teeth. These are less noticeable than the traditional metal braces but are also more expensive as compared to the metal braces.</p>

                        <p>Lingual braces are the same as traditional metal braces, except that the brackets and wires are placed on the inside of teeth.  These are invisible from outside but have a lot of disadvantages such as they are difficult to clean and are much more expensive. These can also cause tongue irritation at times. These types of braces are widely used for braces treatment in Delhi.</p>

This is the most expensive option and the treatment time will depend on patient compliance.</p>
